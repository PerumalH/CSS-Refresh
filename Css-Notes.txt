What is CSS?
make a web page look good - style the page.

History:
1996 Version 1 - css 1
1998 version 2 - css 2
In Development - css 3 - split up into independent Modules


Basics Of CSS :-

1. How to Add CSS to Html
2. Setting up CSS Rules
3. Selectors, Properties, Values 
4. Conflicting Styles


Three Different Way:

inline Style - inside the tag
internal style - inside the html page Inbetween head section - using Selector
External Style - use the css file to style the web, for connect the page. we use link element in html page.

Selector:-

1. Element Tag Selector
2. Class Selector -we can reuse the class selector to another tag, also add multiple classes by space between -.
3. Universal Selector - * - rarely use this one.
4. IDs - one id to one specific element, we don't use same Id for other Element - #
5. Attributes - set equal style to all elements with attribues - [Attribute Name]

cascading style sheet - multiple rules can apply to the same Element.
Specificity - resolve conflict arising from multiple Rules
*** low to high priority.

1. tag and ::pseudo-element selector
2. class :pseudo-class and [attribute] selector
3. #id selector
4. Inline Styles

inheritance - element inherit some style from parent element(Low Specificity)
Combinator :- Combine multiple Selector.

1. Adjacent Sibling - h2 + p {}
  direct sibling -> second comes after h2 tag 
  *immediate following

2. general sibling - h2 ~ p {}
 The general sibling selector (~) selects all elements 
 that are next siblings of a specified element.

3. child - div > p{}
  direct child of first element.

4. descendant - div p{}
  all p tags would apply, inside of the div.


selector, properties, value: predefine,color,size,function

CSS Box Model- every element work as a box.

Margin Collapsing - bigger element margin wins - use either margin-top and margin-botton. to rid of that.

When working with margins, you can get unexpected results. 

Why are two adjacent elements sharing one margin even though each element has its own one?
Why does a parent element (e.g. <section>  as in the videos) suddenly take on the margin of the child element (e.g. <h1> )?
It's always related to margin collapsing. You can dive deeply into it with the help of the following awesome article: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing

There, three base cases are described:

Adjacent siblings which both have margins
A parent which holds one or more child elements where the first and/ or last (or the only) child has margins
An element without content, padding, border and height
Let's explore these cases:

1. Adjacent Siblings

In this case, the first element might have a margin of 10px  (on all sides let's say) and the second one has 5px  (or 20px  - the values don't matter).
CSS will collapse the margins and only add the bigger one between the elements. 
So if we got margins of 10px  and 5px , a 10px  margin would be added between the elements?

2. A parent with children that have a margin
To be precise, the first and/ or last or the only child has to have margins (top and/ or bottom). 
In that case, the parent elements margin will collapse with the child element(s)' margins. 
Again, the bigger margin wins and will be applied to the parent element.
If the parent element has padding, inline content (other than the child elements) or a border, 
this behavior should not occur, the child margin will instead be added to the content of the wrapping parent element.

3. An empty element with margins
This case probably doesn't occur that often but if you got an element with no content, 
no padding, no border and no height, then the top and bottom margin will be merged into one single margin. Again, the bigger one wins.

Shorthand Properties:- combined value of multiple properties in a single property

Height & width - it's include only the size of the content ,
 not border,margin,padding
if we add the b,m,p. it'will override the page.
to rid of that, we have to use box-sizing


pseudo classes and pseudo Element

grouping rule - using the comma(,)

More on Css Class:

1. multiple classes on one Element
2. same-element combination  - chain selector
3. css class - re-usable, most usable type selector, 
allow you to mark and name things for styling purpose only
4. css Id - only used once per page, use if available anyways,
also got non-css meaning (e.g on page link)

!important - overwrites specifity and all other Selectors

DON'T USE !important

:not() psuedo classes -

to make a line like a card template, 
we have to display the every single container as inline-block.
